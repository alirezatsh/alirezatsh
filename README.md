# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there!  

I'm a **backend developer** who loves crafting cool stuff with **Python**, **Django**, and **DRF**.  
I also have experience with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Bootstrap** on the frontend side and working with various **databases**.  
Lately, I've been exploring **Linux systems**, and Iâ€™m absolutely loving it!  

Always excited to learn new skills, take on challenges, and grow as a developer. ðŸš€
